# build-stockly-William-VanOrder
Repo for our very own William VanOrder. He will be making an awesome marketing page. Looking forward to it.


This Repo is for a marketing page for the Stockly app. All files have been sorted to their respective folders, and the 'node_modules' package contains the animate,less library used for animations**. 

This project contains use of DOM manipulation, components within the JS files, and requires LESS for compiling. The calls to action are located both in the NavBar and in the button at the bottom of the index.html.

The two live pages are the index.html and the team.html. Both pages have respective .less files, .js files, and images.
